# ArasakaAsset Manager

Welcome to the ArasakaAsset Manager repository! This project is a mvp for the management of digital assets for my Cyberpunk Red Campaign (and probably other games). It has a nice retro theme. Please notice, that this is the frontend only, the backend you are looking for is in another repo.

- **Asset Cataloguing**: Organize your digital assets with ease, allowing for quick searching, tagging, and retrieval.
- **Access Control**: Manage user permissions to ensure that sensitive assets are protected and only available to authorized personnel.
